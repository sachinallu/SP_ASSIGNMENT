QUESTION:Write a sign up program for a user that asks the user to enter a USERNAME and a PASSWORD.This login and password are written into file in the following format:
	username1,password1
	username2,password2
	username3,password3
	username4,password4
	username5,password5
	.....
If the username entered is already exist in the file then it inform the user that the username entered already exist and it will prompt the user to choose another username.

Code is written in C.Since we used command line arguments to take input so to run the code we use 
$ ./a.out -f <input_file> -l <log_file>
where input_file is the file that contains data and the log.txt is the file whererecord of all activities and events that happen in a program. 



Make sure that input_file already exists.
